  "readme": "# win-spawn\n\n  Spawn for node.js but in a way that works regardless of which OS you're using.  Use this if you want to use spawn with a JavaScript file.  It works by explicitly invoking node on windows.  It also shims support for environment variable setting by attempting to parse the command with a regex.  Since all modification is wrapped in `if (os === 'Windows_NT')` it can be safely used on non-windows systems and will not break anything.\n\n## Installation\n\n  $ npm install win-spawn\n\n## Usage\n\n### Command Line\n\n  All the following will work exactly as if the 'win-spawn ' prefix was ommitted when on unix.\n\n    $ win-spawn foo\n    $ win-spawn ./bin/foo\n    $ win-spawn NODE_PATH=./lib foo\n    $ win-spawn NODE_PATH=./lib foo arg1 arg2\n\n  You can also transform all the line endings in a directory from `\\r\\n` to `\\n` just by running:\n\n    $ win-line-endings\n\n  You can preview the changes by running:\n\n    $ win-line-endings -p\n\n  It will ignore `node_modules` and `.git` by default, but is not clever enough to recognise binary files yet.\n\n### API\n\nThis will just pass through to `child_process.spawn` on unix systems, but will correctly parse the arguments on windows.\n\n```javascript\nspawn('foo', [], {stdio: 'inherit'});\nspawn('./bin/foo', [], {stdio: 'inherit'});\nspawn('NODE_PATH=./lib foo', [], {stdio: 'inherit'});\nspawn('NODE_PATH=./lib foo', [arg1, arg2], {stdio: 'inherit'});\n```\n\n![viewcount](https://viewcount.jepso.com/count/ForbesLindesay/win-spawn.png)\n",
