  "readme": "# grunt-concurrent [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/grunt-concurrent.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/grunt-concurrent) [![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)\n\n> Run grunt tasks concurrently\n\nRunning slow tasks like Coffee and Sass concurrently can potentially improve your build time significantly. This task is also useful if you need to run multiple blocking tasks like `nodemon` and `watch` at once, as seen in the example config.\n\n![screenshot](screenshot.png)\n\nThis task is similar to grunt-parallel, but more focused by leaving out support for shell scripts which results in a leaner config. It also has a smaller dependency size and pads the output of concurrent tasks, as seen above.\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you haven't used [grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide, as it explains how to create a [gruntfile][Getting Started] as well as install and use grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, install this plugin with this command:\n\n```sh\nnpm install grunt-concurrent --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-concurrent');\n```\n\n*Tip: the [load-grunt-tasks](https://github.com/sindresorhus/load-grunt-tasks) module makes it easier to load multiple grunt tasks.*\n\n\n[grunt]: http://gruntjs.com\n[Getting Started]: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki/Getting-started\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee the [Gruntfile](Gruntfile.js) in this repo for a full example.\n\nJust specify the tasks you want to run concurrently as an array in a target of this task as shown below.\n\n\n### Example config\n\nThis will first run the Coffee and Sass tasks at the same time, then the JSHint and Mocha tasks at the same time.\n\n```javascript\ngrunt.initConfig({\n\tconcurrent: {\n\t\ttarget1: ['coffee', 'sass'],\n\t\ttarget2: ['jshint', 'mocha']\n\t}\n});\n\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-concurrent');\ngrunt.registerTask('default', ['concurrent:target1', 'concurrent:target2']);\n```\n\n\n## Options\n\n### limit\n\nType: `Number`  \nDefault: Number of CPU cores (`require('os').cpus().length`) with a minimum of 2\n\nLimit of how many tasks that are run concurrently.\n\n### logConcurrentOutput\n\nType: `Boolean`  \nDefault: `false`\n\nYou can optionally log the output of your concurrent tasks by specifying the `logConcurrentOutput` option. Here is an example config which runs [grunt-nodemon](https://github.com/ChrisWren/grunt-nodemon) to launch and monitor a node server and [grunt-contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) to watch for asset changes all in one terminal tab:\n\n```javascript\ngrunt.initConfig({\n\tconcurrent: {\n\t\ttarget: {\n\t\t\ttasks: ['nodemon', 'watch'],\n\t\t\toptions: {\n\t\t\t\tlogConcurrentOutput: true\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n});\n\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-concurrent');\ngrunt.registerTask('default', ['concurrent:target']);\n```\n\n*Note the output will be messy when combining certain tasks. This option is best used with tasks that don't exit like watch and nodemon to monitor the output of long-running concurrent tasks.*\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [Sindre Sorhus](http://sindresorhus.com)\n",
