# i18n

Lightweight simple translation module with dynamic json storage. Supports plain vanilla node.js apps and should work with any framework (like _express_, _restify_ and probably more) that exposes an `app.use()` method passing in `res` and `req` objects.
Uses common __('...') syntax in app and templates.
Stores language files in json files compatible to [webtranslateit](http://webtranslateit.com/) json format.
Adds new strings on-the-fly when first used in your app.
No extra parsing needed.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mashpie/i18n-node.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mashpie/i18n-node)

## Install

	npm install i18n
	
## Test 

	npm test

## Load

	// load modules
	var express = require('express'),
	    i18n = require("i18n");
	
now you are ready to use a global `i18n.__('Hello')`. **Global** assumes you share a common state of localization in any time and any part of your app. This is usually fine in cli-style scripts. When serving responses to http requests you'll need to make sure that scope is __NOT__ shared globally but attached to your request object.

## Configure

Minimal example, just setup two locales

    i18n.configure({
        locales:['en', 'de']
    });

### list of configuration options

	i18n.configure({
	    // setup some locales - other locales default to en silently
	    locales:['en', 'de'],

	    // you may alter a site wide default locale
	    defaultLocale: 'de',

	    // sets a custom cookie name to parse locale settings from  - defaults to NULL
	    cookie: 'yourcookiename',

	    // where to store json files - defaults to './locales'
	    directory: './mylocales',

	    // whether to write new locale information to disk - defaults to true
	    updateFiles: false,

	    // what to use as the indentation unit - defaults to "\t"
	    indent: "\t",

	    // setting extension of json files - defaults to '.json' (you might want to set this to '.js' according to webtranslateit)
	    extension: '.js',
	});

## Example usage in gobal scope

In your app, when not registered to a specific object:

	var greeting = i18n.__('Hello');

## Example usage in express.js

In an express app, you might use i18n.init to gather language settings of your visitors and also bind your helpers to response object honoring request objects locale, ie:

	// Configuration
	app.configure(function() {

    	[...]

	    // default: using 'accept-language' header to guess language settings
	    app.use(i18n.init);

	    [...]
	});

in your apps methods:

	app.get('/de', function(req, res){
      var greeting = res.__('Hello');
    });


in your templates (depending on your template engine)
	
	<%= __('Hello') %>
	
	${__('Hello')}

## API

### __()

Translates a single phrase and adds it to locales if unknown. Returns translated parsed and substituted string.

	// template and global (this.locale == 'de')
	__('Hello'); // Hallo
	__('Hello %s', 'Marcus'); // Hallo Marcus

	// scoped via req object (req.locale == 'de')
	req.__('Hello'); // Hallo
	req.__('Hello %s', 'Marcus'); // Hallo Marcus

	// passing specific locale
	__({phrase: 'Hello', locale: 'fr'}); // Salut
	__({phrase: 'Hello %s', locale: 'fr'}, 'Marcus'); // Salut Marcus

### __n()

Plurals translation of a single phrase. Singular and plural forms will get added to locales if unknown. Returns translated parsed and substituted string based on `count` parameter.

	// template and global (this.locale == 'de')
	__n("%s cat", "%s cats", 1); // 1 Katze
	__n("%s cat", "%s cats", 3); // 3 Katzen

	// scoped via req object (req.locale == 'de')
	req.__n("%s cat", "%s cats", 1); // 1 Katze
	req.__n("%s cat", "%s cats", 3); // 3 Katzen

	// passing specific locale
	__n({singular: "%s cat", plural: "%s cats", locale: "fr"}, 1); // 1 chat
	__n({singular: "%s cat", plural: "%s cats", locale: "fr"}, 3); // 3 chat

	__n({singular: "%s cat", plural: "%s cats", locale: "fr", count: 1}); // 1 chat
	__n({singular: "%s cat", plural: "%s cats", locale: "fr", count: 3}); // 3 chat

### setLocale()

Setting the current locale (ie.: `en`) globally or in current scope.

	setLocale('de');
	setLocale(req, 'de');
	req.setLocale('de');

### getLocale()

Getting the current locale (ie.: `en`) from current scope or globally.

	getLocale(); // --> de
	getLocale(req); // --> de
	req.getLocale(); // --> de

### getCatalog()

Returns a whole catalog optionally based on current scope and locale.

	getCatalog(); // returns all locales
	getCatalog('de'); // returns just 'de'

	getCatalog(req); // returns all locales
	getCatalog(req, 'de'); // returns just 'de'

	req.getCatalog(); // returns all locales
	req.getCatalog('de'); // returns just 'de'



## Optionally manual attaching helpers for different template engines

In general i18n has to be attached to the response object to let it's public api get accessible in your templates and methods. As of **0.4.0** i18n tries to do so internally via `i18n.init`, as if you were doing it in `app.configure` on your own:

	app.use(function(req, res, next) {
		// express helper for natively supported engines
		res.locals.__ = res.__ = function() {
			return i18n.__.apply(req, arguments);
		};

		[...]

		next();
	});

Different engines need different implementations, so yours might miss or not work with the current default helpers. This one showing an example for mustache in express:

	// register helper as a locals function wrapped as mustache expects
	app.use(function (req, res, next) {
		// mustache helper
		res.locals.__ = function () {
		  return function (text, render) {
		    return i18n.__.apply(req, arguments);
		  };
		};		
		
		[...]

		next();
	});

You could still setup your own implementation. Please refer to Examples below, post an issue or contribute your setup.

## Output parsing of expressions

As inspired by gettext there is currently support for sprintf-style expressions. Named parameters are on roadmap.

### sprintf support

	var greeting = __('Hello %s, how are you today?', 'Marcus');
	
this puts *Hello Marcus, how are you today?*. You might add endless arguments and even nest it.

	var greeting = __('Hello %s, how are you today? How was your %s.', 'Marcus', __('weekend'));
	
which puts *Hello Marcus, how are you today? How was your weekend.*

### variable support

you might even use dynamic variables as they get interpreted on the fly. Better make sure no user input finds it's way to that point as they all get added to the `en.js` file if not yet existing.

	var greetings = ['Hi', 'Hello', 'Howdy'];        
    for (var i=0; i < greetings.length; i++) {
        console.log( __(greetings[i]) );
    };

which puts 

	Hi
	Hello
	Howdy

### basic plural support

two different plural forms are supported as response to `count`:

	var singular = __n('%s cat', '%s cats', 1);
    var plural = __n('%s cat', '%s cats', 3);

this puts **1 cat** or **3 cats**
and again these could get nested:

	var singular = __n('There is one monkey in the %%s', 'There are %d monkeys in the %%s', 1, 'tree');
	var plural = __n('There is one monkey in the %%s', 'There are %d monkeys in the %%s', 3, 'tree');
	
putting *There is one monkey in the tree* or *There are 3 monkeys in the tree*

## Storage

Will get modular support for different storage engines, currently just json files are stored in filesystem.

### json file

the above will automatically generate a `en.json` by default inside `./locales/` which looks like

	{
		"Hello": "Hello",
		"Hello %s, how are you today?": "Hello %s, how are you today?",
		"weekend": "weekend",
		"Hello %s, how are you today? How was your %s.": "Hello %s, how are you today? How was your %s.",
		"Hi": "Hi",
		"Howdy": "Howdy",
		"%s cat": {
			"one": "%s cat",
			"other": "%s cats"
		},
		"There is one monkey in the %%s": {
			"one": "There is one monkey in the %%s",
			"other": "There are %d monkeys in the %%s"
		},
		"tree": "tree"
	}

that file can be edited or just uploaded to [webtranslateit](http://docs.webtranslateit.com/file_formats/) for any kind of collaborative translation workflow:

	{
		"Hello": "Hallo",
		"Hello %s, how are you today?": "Hallo %s, wie geht es dir heute?",
		"weekend": "Wochenende",
		"Hello %s, how are you today? How was your %s.": "Hallo %s, wie geht es dir heute? Wie war dein %s.",
		"Hi": "Hi",
		"Howdy": "HallÃ¶chen",
		"%s cat": {
			"one": "%s Katze",
			"other": "%s Katzen"
		},
		"There is one monkey in the %%s": {
			"one": "Im %%s sitzt ein Affe",
			"other": "Im %%s sitzen %d Affen"
		},
		"tree": "Baum"
	}

## Logging & Debugging

Logging any kind of output is moved to [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) module. To let i18n output anything run your app with `DEBUG` env set like so:

	$ DEBUG=i18n:* node app.js

i18n exposes three log-levels:

* i18n:debug
* i18n:warn
* i18n:error

if you only want to get errors and warnings reported start your node server like so:

	$ DEBUG=i18n:warn,i18n:error node app.js

Combine those settings with you existing application if any of you other modules or libs also uses __debug__
